/* Interpret commands intended for 28SF040 flash
 *
 * The Z80 will output commands and an addres. In order to properly handle a
 * write, we have to interpret these commands like it were an actual 28SF040.
 *
 * The read path of the dataflash does not have a command associated with it,
 * therefore this is function is only useful for writing/erasing the DF
 *
 * Software data protection status is _NOT_ implemented by this functions, it
 * seems to not be use by the Mailstation in normal application flow.
 *
 * Returns 1 if the dataflash was actually modified. Otherwise returns 0
 *
 * While there are a few different possible errors, they are not indicated
 * as a return value at this time.
 *
 * TODO: Add debugging hook here.
