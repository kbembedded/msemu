
Mailstation Emulator has been written for GCC-compatible compilers only.  It's
not been tested in Visual Studio, and chances are you would have a job on your
hands trying to compile it there.  The EXE included in this archive was built
with MinGW (http://www.mingw.org), which is the Windows version of GCC.


To compile msemu, you'll need the following libraries:

- SDL
  (http://www.libsdl.org/)

- SDL_gfx
  (http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/)

- z80em
  (http://www.komkon.org/~dekogel/misc.html)


SDL and SDL_gfx should be installed in locations which your compiler can find
by default.  The z80em headers and compiled object file however are expected 
to be found in "./z80em", a directory inside the msemu source directory.

If you have any problems, email me at fyberoptic@gmail.com and we'll see if
we can get it working for you.

-----------------------------

NOTE:  On Windows, the default behavior of SDLmain is to redirect STDOUT to 
stdout.txt, resulting in normal console output being hidden (and written to 
that file).  There's some solutions for that, if it bothers you:

  a.)  Set the environment variable "SDL_STDIO_REDIRECT" to 0 before running
       msemu.
  b.)  There's kind of a fix for it in the RedirectIOToConsole() in msemu.c 
       which you can uncomment, but this will leave behind an empty
       stdout.txt.
  c.)  Compile SDL yourself with the --disable-stdio-redirect option.  
  
If you don't care about console output anyway, then don't worry about it!

-----------------------------

When compiling the z80em library, you'll probably want to edit its makefile
to change:

CFLAGS	= -Wall -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DLSB_FIRST -DDEBUG

to

CFLAGS	= -Wall -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -DLSB_FIRST -DX86_ASM

This makes the CPU emulation use assembly code optimizations for the best
possible emulation speed.  If by some crazy chance you're not using an x86-
based computer, however, then you should leave that off!  In fact, if you do
compile it on something such as a PPC Mac or whatever, I'd love to hear if
the Mailstation Emulator works for you.
